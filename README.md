# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles used on Linux and macOS systems. They might not prove useful to you, but if they do, feel free to use any snippets however you please. To deploy these dotfiles to a new system, [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) should be used which is a small handy dotfiles manager written in Go.
